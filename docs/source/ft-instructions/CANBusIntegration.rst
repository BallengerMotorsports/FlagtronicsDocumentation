CAN Bus integration
=======================

    The FT200 has a CAN Bus option on the 8 Way connector at the back of the display. The FT200 will offer the ability to send flag status over CAN to any CAN enabled dash or logging system. We have tested integration with AiM and Race Capture Pro currently and plan to make templates available as well as integration write-ups on our website.
