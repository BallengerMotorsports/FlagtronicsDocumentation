Import your car list
=======================

To import your car list into the Track Director Software, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Car List File**:

   Create a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file containing the details of all cars participating in the race. Include information such as car number, driver name, team, and any other relevant details.

2. **Open Track Director Software**:

   Launch the Track Director Software on your computer.

3. **Navigate to Import Car List**:

   In the Track Director interface, locate the option to import car data. This is typically found in the "File" menu.

4. **Select Car List File**:

   Click on the option to import car data and choose the CSV file prepared earlier from your file system.

5. **Map CSV Columns**:

   Follow the on-screen instructions to map the columns of the CSV file to the corresponding fields in the Track Director Software. Ensure that each field is correctly mapped to its respective data type.

6. **Confirm Import**:

   Once the mapping is complete, confirm the import process. The Track Director Software will import the car list data from the CSV file into its database.

.. note::
   
   It's recommended to verify the imported car list data within the Track Director Software interface to ensure accuracy and completeness.
