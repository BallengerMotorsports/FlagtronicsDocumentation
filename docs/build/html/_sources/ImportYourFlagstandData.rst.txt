Import your flagstand data 
=======================================

To import flagstand data into the Track Director Software, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Flagstand Data File**:

   Create a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file containing the details of all flagstands on the track. Include information such as flagstand ID, location, assigned personnel, and any other relevant details.

2. **Open Track Director Software**:

   Launch the Track Director Software on your computer.

3. **Navigate to Import Flagstand Data**:

   In the Track Director interface, locate the option to import flagstand data. This is typically found in the "File" menu.

4. **Select Flagstand Data File**:

   Click on the option to import flagstand data and choose the CSV file prepared earlier from your file system.

5. **Map CSV Columns**:

   Follow the on-screen instructions to map the columns of the CSV file to the corresponding fields in the Track Director Software. Ensure that each field is correctly mapped to its respective data type.

6. **Confirm Import**:

   Once the mapping is complete, confirm the import process. The Track Director Software will import the flagstand data from the CSV file into its database.

.. note::
   
   It's recommended to verify the imported flagstand data within the Track Director Software interface to ensure accuracy and completeness.
