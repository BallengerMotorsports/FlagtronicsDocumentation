Full Course Flagging
=======================

Full course flagging functions can be found in the top right region of the software.

When there is no broadcaster present or no flag is commanded, all flags will be displayed gray

Your full course flagging conditions are as follows:

- Green Flag: Racing under normal or mostly normal conditions can occur
- Yellow Flag: All zones of the track will be a "Full Course Yellow / FCY" or "Double Yellow". This command is typically used to either collect the cars behind the pace car or on the ends of a Code 35/60 condition.
- Red Flag: All racing must stop.
- Black Flag: All cars on track must report to pit lane. Typically this is used at the end of a session or heat.
- Checkered Flag: Commanded as the first place car comes to the finish line on the last lap at the end of the race.
- Blank Flag: This is a power-saving command that puts signboards to a blank state and broadcasters to a low power state.

======================
Local Course Flagging
======================

Local course flagging can be commanded by clicking on a flagstand (distinguished by a flag icon) on the map and clicking on one of the options that appear surrounding the selected flagstand.

Your local course flagging conditions are as follows:

- Waving Yellow: Used in severe incidents at the immediate location of the incident.
- White: Used to let drivers know of Debris.
- Standing Yellow:
- Clear:

This action is usually performed when acting as a backup flagger to the individual in the flagstand from race control or when there is an absence of an individual in the flagstand.
