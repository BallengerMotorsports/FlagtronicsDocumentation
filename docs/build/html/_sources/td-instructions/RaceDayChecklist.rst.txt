Race Day Checklist
==================

To prepare for the race day, follow these steps:

**Load Track**:

   Ensure that the track data is loaded into the Track Director Software. This includes configuring the track layout, corner stations, and other relevant details.

**Load Car Data**:

   Import car data into the Track Director Software. This data should include information about each participating car, such as car number, driver name, team, etc.

**Broadcasters and Corner Stations Check**:

   Verify that all broadcasters are responding timely and as expected. Ensure that corner stations are also responding as expected, providing accurate data during the race.

**Start OBS Studio for Live Streaming**:

   Launch OBS Studio and initiate live streaming to the Flagtronics YouTube account. Set the stream to be unlisted.

**Provide Live Stream to Race Control and Media Personnel**:

   Share the live stream link with Race Control and Media personnel to enable them to monitor the race in real-time.

**Start Race Process**:

   Begin the race before the first car crosses the starting line. Ensure all systems are ready and in place for a smooth start.

**Real-Time Debug and Feedback**:

   Throughout the race, provide real-time debug and feedback for any issues that arise. Be specific about unit numbers, software versions, and conditions triggering any bugs.

**Race Control Awareness**:

   Stay alert and attentive to Race Control communications. If available, use a Race Control headset to monitor calls with extreme awareness.

**Utilize Slack for Communication**:

   Utilize Slack to communicate with team members, pool resources, and get real-time answers to questions that may arise during the event.

**Race Stop Procedure**:

    Stop the race after cars cross the checkered flag. Consider adjusting the workflow to end the race at the checkered flag and allow one additional crossing for each car.
