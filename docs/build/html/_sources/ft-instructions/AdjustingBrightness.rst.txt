Adjusting brightness
======================

When the FT200 is on, adjust brightness up by using the top button, B1 and down by using the bottom button, B2.

By default, the FT200 has 6 light curves. 1 is low, 2 is medium, 3 is high brightness with automatic light sensor compensation. In this setting the FT200 will evaluate the light conditions with the sensor at the back of the FT200 and set the brightness accordingly. Curve 4 is low, 5 is medium, 6 is high brightness with no evaluation of the light sensor.

These curves may be programmed via Windows PC software.
